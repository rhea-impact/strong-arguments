Foundational reading for the strong-arguments framework. Organized by what each contributes.

## Classical Foundations

| Book | Author | Contribution |
|------|--------|--------------|
| *Rhetoric* | Aristotle | Original framework: logos (logic), ethos (credibility), pathos (emotion). Still the foundation. |
| *Prior Analytics* | Aristotle | Syllogistic logic. How valid arguments are structured. |
| *The Art of Being Right* | Schopenhauer | 38 stratagems for winning debates. Useful to *recognize*, not to use. Know what bad-faith tactics look like. |

## Informal Logic & Fallacies

| Book | Author | Contribution |
|------|--------|--------------|
| *Informal Logic: A Pragmatic Approach* | Douglas Walton | Modern academic standard. Fallacies in context, not just pattern-matching. |
| *Fallacies* | Charles Hamblin | Why fallacy theory is harder than it looks. Historical survey, critical analysis. |
| *A Rulebook for Arguments* | Anthony Weston | Concise, practical. Good for quick reference. |

## Epistemology & Rationality

| Book | Author | Contribution |
|------|--------|--------------|
| *Thinking, Fast and Slow* | Daniel Kahneman | System 1 (fast/intuitive) vs System 2 (slow/deliberate). Cognitive biases, heuristics. Essential. |
| *Rationality: From AI to Zombies* | Eliezer Yudkowsky | LessWrong sequences. Bayesian reasoning, calibration, motivated reasoning, the map is not the territory. |
| *Superforecasting* | Philip Tetlock | What makes predictions accurate. Calibrated confidence, updating on evidence, foxes vs hedgehogs. |
| *The Enigma of Reason* | Mercier & Sperber | Provocative thesis: reason evolved for argumentation (winning social disputes), not truth-seeking. Explains why we're bad at solo reasoning but better in adversarial contexts. |
| *Rationality* | Steven Pinker | Recent, accessible survey. Logic, probability, Bayesian reasoning, cognitive biases, why rationality matters. |

## Cognitive Biases & Decision-Making

| Book | Author | Contribution |
|------|--------|--------------|
| *Influence* | Robert Cialdini | Six principles of persuasion: reciprocity, commitment/consistency, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity. Know these to resist them. |
| *Predictably Irrational* | Dan Ariely | Systematic cognitive biases in decision-making. We're not randomly irrational—we're predictably irrational. |
| *Nudge* | Thaler & Sunstein | Choice architecture. How framing and defaults shape decisions. |
| *The Intelligence Trap* | David Robson | Smart people make dumb mistakes. Why intelligence doesn't protect against bias. |

## Philosophy of Science

| Book | Author | Contribution |
|------|--------|--------------|
| *The Logic of Scientific Discovery* | Karl Popper | Falsifiability as demarcation criterion. Claims must be testable to be scientific. |
| *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* | Thomas Kuhn | Paradigm shifts, normal science, incommensurability. How scientific consensus changes. |
| *Against Method* | Paul Feyerabend | Methodological anarchism. Skepticism about universal scientific method. Useful counterpoint. |

## Argumentation Theory

| Book | Author | Contribution |
|------|--------|--------------|
| *The Uses of Argument* | Stephen Toulmin | Toulmin model: claim, grounds, warrant, backing, qualifier, rebuttal. More nuanced than syllogisms. |
| *A Systematic Theory of Argumentation* | van Eemeren & Grootendorst | Pragma-dialectics. Argumentation as dialogue with rules. Ten commandments for critical discussion. |
| *Argumentation: The Study of Effective Reasoning* | David Zarefsky | Great Courses lecture series. Accessible introduction. |

## Scientific Skepticism

| Book | Author | Contribution |
|------|--------|--------------|
| *The Demon-Haunted World* | Carl Sagan | Baloney detection kit. Scientific skepticism for the public. How to think critically without cynicism. |
| *Bad Science* | Ben Goldacre | Media science reporting, statistical misuse, placebo effect, cherry-picking. |
| *How to Lie with Statistics* | Darrell Huff | Classic. Statistical manipulation techniques to recognize. |

## Rhetoric & Persuasion (Know Thy Enemy)

| Book | Author | Contribution |
|------|--------|--------------|
| *Thank You for Arguing* | Jay Heinrichs | Modern rhetoric. Persuasion techniques, useful for recognition. |
| *Words That Work* | Frank Luntz | Political messaging. How framing shapes perception. (Luntz is a practitioner, not a theorist—read critically.) |

| *The Death of Expertise* | Tom Nichols | Why people reject expert knowledge. Anti-intellectualism and its mechanisms. |

## Game Theory & Strategic Interaction

| Book | Author | Contribution |
|------|--------|--------------|
| *The Strategy of Conflict* | Thomas Schelling | Credible commitments, focal points, strategic moves. Argumentation has game-theoretic structure. |
| *Thinking Strategically* | Dixit & Nalebuff | Accessible game theory. Useful for understanding adversarial dynamics. |

## Suggested Reading Order

If starting from scratch:

1. **Kahneman - *Thinking, Fast and Slow*** — Foundational cognitive science
2. **Sagan - *The Demon-Haunted World*** — Scientific skepticism, accessible
3. **Cialdini - *Influence*** — Know the persuasion playbook
4. **Tetlock - *Superforecasting*** — Calibration and updating
5. **Walton - *Informal Logic*** — Technical fallacy theory
6. **Mercier & Sperber - *The Enigma of Reason*** — Why this is all harder than it looks

*This list is intentionally broad. Not every book is directly about argumentation, but all inform how to think about thinking.*
