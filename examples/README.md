# Argument Domains

A catalog of common arguments, why they persist, and whether they're resolvable.

## Resolvability Levels

| Level | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Conditional** | Has an answer, but depends on context | Rent vs buy |
| **Mixed** | Some aspects resolvable, others not | Diet debates |
| **Low** | Core disagreement is about values | Abortion, politics |
| **None** | Pure preference or tribal identity | Pineapple on pizza |

## Why Arguments Never Resolve

| Pattern | What's Happening | What To Do |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| **Pure Preference** | No objective answer—just taste | Say "I prefer" not "X is better" |
| **Values-Based** | Different optimization targets | Surface the value difference |
| **Context-Dependent** | Right answer varies by situation | Identify variables, analyze specifics |
| **Unfalsifiable** | Can't be tested or proven wrong | Acknowledge epistemic limits |
| **Identity/Tribal** | Position = group membership | Recognize when you're defending identity |
| **Asymmetric Info** | Different experiences can't be shared | Listen more, argue less |

## The Meta-Question

Before engaging in any argument, ask:

1. **Is this resolvable?** Check the patterns above.
2. **What type of disagreement is it?** Facts, values, or preferences?
3. **What would change my mind?** If nothing, you're not truth-seeking.
4. **What would change theirs?** If nothing, they're not truth-seeking.
5. **Is this worth my time?** Low-resolvability + high-emotion = probably not.
